[Tagline: Open-Source, Science-Backed Voting for Real Democracy]

Welcome to **zvote** — a free, open-source voting platform designed to bring advanced, scientifically proven voting methods directly to everyday decisions and democratic systems.

## Vision

At **zvote**, we believe current voting systems imposed by governments are outdated and inadequate. Our mission is to empower people everywhere with better voting tools based on robust science — starting from simple daily choices like picking restaurants or gathering dates, to ultimately driving democratic reform worldwide.

The name **zvote** is currently a working title. It may be updated as the project evolves and branding directions clarify.

## Why zvote?

- **Open Source & Free:** Fully transparent and accessible to all.
- **Science-Based Methods:** Implements Approval Voting and Majority Judgment to improve vote expressiveness and fairness.
- **Dynamic, Live Voting:** Inspired by technologies like spacetimedb, allowing opinions to evolve over time for more authentic consent.
- **Clean, Modern Design:** Minimalist black and white with subtle solar punk-inspired gradients of blue, green, and orange.
- **Real-Life Impact:** Practical for everyday decisions, scalable to civic elections and beyond.

## Features (Roadmap)

- Approval Voting and Majority Judgment modes
- Live, revisable voting over time
- Simple, intuitive UI
- Open API for integration and extension
- Privacy and security first

## Use Cases
**zvote** is designed to be flexible and fun, applicable to everyday decisions and ambitious collaborative endeavors alike. Here are some envisioned use cases to inspire and motivate:

- Choosing restaurants or venues among friends for social gatherings.
- Selecting community representatives or leaders using fair and expressive voting systems.
- Deciding directions and strategies collectively in interactive experiences like Twitch Plays Pokémon, integrating with technologies such as spacetimedb and Kyber to enable synchronized, low-latency group control.
- Pioneering a real-time "neural network" of collective decision making where many participants and AI systems collaborate seamlessly — for example, multiple surgeons and AI-driven assistants performing a complex operation together, combining precision with consensus in milliseconds.
- Exploring how dynamic, live decision-making platforms can unlock new potentials for human progress, collaboration, and trust.

## Licensing and Repository Structure

This project aims to maintain openness, transparency, and community trust by carefully managing code and design licenses:

This encourages wide adoption, modification, and even proprietary use.

- The **user interface, website design, graphics, and other creative assets** will be maintained in a separate repository with a different license. This license will protect the artistic and design work from unauthorized commercial use or reuse in artificial intelligence datasets without explicit permission. For example, the design assets repo may use a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license or a custom license with similar restrictions.

This separation allows the open source community to freely build upon the voting logic while ensuring that creative contributions receive the respect and protection they deserve.
