# Vote Visibility Badges

- **Persona**: Visitor or organizer
- **Goal**: Quickly recognize whether a vote is Public, Unlisted, or Private from the UI.
- **Desired outcome/flow**:
  - Lists and detail views show a clear badge indicating visibility.
  - Badge colors convey at-a-glance meaning (e.g., Public = green, Unlisted = orange, Private = red).

## Acceptance criteria
- **Consistency**: Badges appear wherever votes are listed or displayed.
- **Clarity**: Text labels match the visibility and use accessible colors.
