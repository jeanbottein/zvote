# Approval Live Counts

- **Persona**: Visitor or participant
- **Goal**: See approval totals per option in real time while voting.
- **Desired outcome/flow**:
  - On the vote page (Approval system), each option displays the current number of approvals.
  - Counts update live as votes are cast or withdrawn.
  - Users see a clear indication of their own approvals.

## Acceptance criteria
- **Accuracy**: Per-option approval totals reflect the latest server aggregate.
- **Real-time**: Changes appear without manual refresh while the page is open.
- **Privacy**: No exposure of which user approved which option.
